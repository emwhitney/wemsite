Caring is anxious—to be full of care, to be careful, is to take care of things by becoming anxious about their future, where the future is embodied in the fragility of an object whose persistence matters. Becoming caring is not about becoming good or nice: people who have “being caring” as their ego ideal often act in quite uncaring ways in order to protect their good image of themselves. To care is not about letting an object go but holding on to an object by letting oneself go, giving oneself over to something that is not one’s own",

Rather, long lasting relief and healing comes from noticing the felt sensations attached to the feelings. THEN, you can work to discharge the intensity and begin shifting the body-based story. The steps we take to heal are not exactly from feeling the intense feelings, but rather, it’s the ability to feel the more descriptive qualities associated with the emotion like the 'heaviness' or 'the frozenness.' By tapping into the deeper layers of how the body actually feels the feelings, we help the intensity move through and out of the cells of the body. When we feel into our bodies using our “felt sense”, the intensity gets diffused, bringing our experience to a more tolerable level. This then makes makes processing the emotional experience a lot more tolerable too. Ultimate change and process comes from that unclear, intangible, fuzzy, murky 'something just feels off and I can’t pinpoint it' kind of awareness.",

Stop looking for love and rejection, and just cultivate love for your own experience.

Stay present; stay in touch with how your body reacts to them without your brain deciding everything for it. Don’t rush anything. Don’t assume anything. Tolerate attention. Remember that your art and your heart are the most important things. Stay open. Remind yourself, every minute, that attention doesn’t always signal that someone is weak and needs you too much. Men can love you and sometimes need your love and still not engulf you completely or object to your setting healthy boundaries. This will leave room for your own hunger. This will leave room for the feelings you don’t want to feel, but you need to feel. This will leave you room to give energy to your creations and your inner life, instead of giving it all away.
